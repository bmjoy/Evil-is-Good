How it works:

1.Select an object(or a prefab) in Asset Folder/Hierarchy. If you click create button without selecting anything, nothing will happen...

2.Choose the pattern you want to creat.

-Floor:an AxB size plane will be created using the object you choose, A and B are the number of tiles.
-Corner:Create 4 corners of a room.
-Wall: Rooms larger than 2x2 will have walls, otherwise you can just create corners.
-Window: Create windows on each wall. Windows will be evenly placed.

3.Click the button and see what happen!
